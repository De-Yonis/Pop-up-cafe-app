Solo project completed between weeks 1 & 6 of the Data Engineering Bootcamp

Overview: 
A software application built with Python for a pop-up cafe so they can create orders for customers. It stores data in a MySQL database and allows the user to perform CRUD operations on their data, based on the following user stories:

As a user I want to:
I want to maintain a collection of products, couriers and orders.
When a customer makes a new order, I need to create this on the system.
I need to be able to update the status of an order.
When I exit my app, I need all data to be persisted and not lost.
When I start my app, I need to load all persisted data.
I need to be sure my app has been tested and proven to work well.


This is a program that runs on the command line (CLI). Simply run the file, and follow the instructions in the terminal
